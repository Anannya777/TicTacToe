# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe GUI game in Python

The TicTacToe GUI game starts with a GUI board. First, the player has to click on any box to start the game. 
It contains the Minimax algorithm; which is a decision rule used for a two-player game. 
We can also see the score of the players at the bottom of the board. A simple 2D GUI is provided for easy gameplay. 
The gameplay design is simple so that users wonâ€™t find it difficult to use and understand.
All the playing rules are the same just like we play in real-time tic tac toe.
